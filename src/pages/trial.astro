                                <p>A private car insurance policy covers your car against financial losses that you may face in case of accident or theft of car. You pay a certain amount as a premium to the insurance company to buy this cover, and they in return agree to pay for accidental damages and theft losses if they arise. As per IRDA (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority), it is compulsory for any vehicle running on Indian roads to be covered under an active car insurance policy.</p>

                                <p class="mb-8">As per the Indian Motors Vehicle Act, third party insurance is mandatory on all the vehicles. Along with that, buying comprehensive car insurance helps you to remain in compliance of regulations and set your mind free too.</p>

                                </p>
                                <p>If your car meets with an accident, you can simply claim insurance and bear the expenses without shedding loads of money from your own pocket.</p>

                                <p class="blue-tex">Safety Against Natural Disasters</p>
                                <p class="mb-8">If your car is damaged due to flood, fire or earthquake, your car insurance policy will come in handy to claim for the damages.</p>

                                <p class="mb-8">Comprehensive car insurance provides you cover against theft and vandalism. You can get your hard-earned money back if your car gets stolen</p>

                                <p>In case no loss arises, you get rewarded a No Claim Bonus (NCB) for not filing any car insurance claim that year. This makes your car insurance renewal premium cheaper</p>

                                    There are various types of add-ons offered by insurance companies listed as follows, but you should select the one according to your specific requirements.</p>
