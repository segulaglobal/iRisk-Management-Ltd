                    <p class="mb-8 leading-loose">A life insurance policy is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder that offers financial coverage under which in the unfortunate event of the insured person's demise during the term of life insurance plans the insurance company guarantees to pay a certain amount to the nominated beneficiary. In exchange, the policyholder agrees to pay a predefined amount of money as premium either on a regular basis or as a single premium. Buying Life Insurance has many advantages including its usage as a loan collateral, smooth continuity of business and also tax benefits.</p>

                                        <p>The purest and most basic form of Life Insurance is called Term Insurance Plan. Term Plans help you safeguard your family from financial worries that arise due to unfortunate circumstances. Term plans are pure risk cover plans with or without maturity benefits. These pure risk plans cover your life at a nominal cost for a specific period or term.
                                        <br><br>
                                        They are all the more important if you are the chief wage earner in your family. No matter how much you have saved or invested over the years, sudden eventualities, such as death or critical illness, always tend to affect your family financially apart from the huge emotional loss. Term plans also let you avail of the benefit to cover your outstanding debts like mortgage, home loan, etc. In case something happens to you, the financial burden is borne by the insurance company and not your loved ones</p>

                                            <ul class="list-disc leading-loose ml-12">
                                                <li><strong>Claim Settlement Ratio</strong> 
                                                <br>
                                                The insurerâ€™s claim settlement ratio provides a clear picture of the insurance provider to the prospect policy buyers. The ratio of claim settlement is released by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) India every year. A claim settlement ratio that is consistently good indicates that the insurance provider has been quick and robust in its claim settlement process
                                            </li>
                                                <li><strong>Solvency Ratio</strong> 
                                                    <br>
                                                    The solvency ratio is something that tells whether the insurance provider chosen will be capable financially for settling the claims if the requirement arises. As per IRDA, every life insurance provider should maintain a solvency ratio of 1.5 at least.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Enhanced Cover</strong> 
                                                    <br>
                                                    Some insurance companies offer the option of enhanced cover in the term insurance policy. In this option, the policyholders can enhance the coverage of the policy under particular circumstances or critical situations.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Riders</strong> 
                                                    <br>
                                                    While purchasing a term plan, it is important to check the rider benefits offered by the insurance company such as terminal illness, critical illness etc. An insurance rider is extra to the essential plan that offers advantages far beyond the subject of the policy in case of any eventuality</li>
                                                <li><strong>Premium</strong> 
                                                    <br>
                                                    The premium rate of a term insurance plan plays a vital role while purchasing the plan. Hence it is important to compare term insurance policies online and choose the term plan which offers higher coverage at an affordable premium rate. Additionally, choose a company that provides discounted premiums to non-smokers</li>

                                        <p>Child plans are a combination of investment and insurance that help in financial planning for your child's future needs. As a parent you can secure your childâ€™s future with plans that include children insurance plans and children education plans. A child plan ensures payment of a lump-sum amount to a child on maturity to cover higher education or marriage expenses</p>

                                        <ul class="list-disc leading-loose ml-12">
                                            <li><strong>Education Corpus</strong> A child plan helps you to build a corpus for your child and save enough for his/her future. With timely premium payments, the lump sum amount helps the child meet later educational expenses without any stress or financial burden.
                                                <br>
                                            A child's education plan is enough to pay for higher education, even in a foreign country. The corpus depends on the terms and conditions of the plan and on the amount invested through premiums.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Kitty for Medical Treatment of the Child</strong> Child plans also allow the option of withdrawing money during the tenure of the child investment plans. This can be used for the medical treatment of the child if he or she falls ill. Such partial withdrawals can come in handy when the child is hospitalized due to an ailment, a minor accident, or a serious medical condition. The best child plan helps to reduce the financial burden caused by medical expenditure and such payouts act as an add-on for one's health insurance plan</li>
                                            <li><strong>Waiver of Premium</strong> The consequences of a parentâ€™s death can be severely damaging for the childâ€™s future. The insurance company offers a premium waiver if the parent (i.e., the insured) passes away during the policy term of a child education plan.The premium waiver benefit often comes inbuilt with the best child education plans and if not, then is available as a rider. The child receives a lump sum amount promised at the time of purchasing the best child plan and does not have to pay the balanced premium</li>
                                            <li><strong>Income Protection</strong> Some child savings plans provide regular income to children, which is equal to 1% of the sum assured if parents are not around to pay the premiums.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Collateral for Higher Education Loans</strong> A Child plan comes in handy if one intends to secure a loan for higher education as they can be used as collaterals. They can be used as collateral for other child-related borrowings as well.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Partial Withdrawal</strong> You can access your funds during the term in the form of partial withdrawals, subject to conditions. This takes care of your childâ€™s different educational milestones</li>
                                            <li><strong>Tax Benefits</strong> A children education plan helps you save tax. You are not only eligible for annual deduction from your total income of upto Rs 1.5 lakhs under Section 80C of the Income-tax Act, 1961, for premiums paid for child plans but you also benefit from tax free maturity proceeds under Section 10(10D) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, subject to fulfilment of the terms and conditions stated therein</li>

                                            <li><strong>No Investment Cap</strong> When there are investment caps upon POMIS and Senior Citizens Savings Scheme there is no such investment cap when it comes to an annuity.</li>
                                            <li><strong>No Risk of Reinvestment</strong> Probably the greatest favourable position that annuities offer is that they dispose of reinvestment chances. Since in India we are moving towards lower financing costs, the hazard is that when you go to reinvest the head, you may get a lower pace of premium. Momentary instruments like the Post Office Monthly Income Scheme  (POMIS) convey reinvestment chances. In any case, when you put resources into an annuity, you are ensured a similar pace of payout forever.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Safety</strong>  An annuity gives you the affirmation that you will keep on accepting cash every month for a mind-blowing remainder. The insurance agency assumes the danger of making sense of how to bring in the cash keep going as long as you live so you don't need to stress over it. Pick your installment recurrence. You may decide to get your fixed payouts at stretches that suit you best - month to month, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly.</li>

                                        <ul class="list-disc leading-loose ml-12">
                                            <li><strong>Immediate Annuity</strong> An Immediate annuity is a contract that is purchased with a single lump-sum payment and in exchange, pays a guaranteed income that starts almost immediately. An immediate payment annuity is especially suitable for retirees who are concerned about outliving their savings.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Deferred Annuity</strong> Deferred annuity is a contract which allows you to save a regular amount of money for your retirement. This type of annuity has two main phases, the savings phase (accumulation phase) in which you invest money into the account, and the income phase (payout pase) in which the plan is converted into an regular annuity and payments are received.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Periodic Annuity</strong>
                                            <br>  
                                            Well periodic annuity essentially provides the funds to the annuitant at the regular point in time. This is more similar to the system of a pension plan wherein the intervals could be based on every month. Besides, the payments could also be done in a phased manner from time to time towards the end of 5th, 10th and 15th years  even though payments of the premiums have been earlier done or not.</li>

                                            Some annuity plans give the alternative of giving a single amount payout. Such a singular amount payout is normally discretionary and accessible after a specific period. In any case, by and large, the whole retirement advantage can't be gotten as a single amount.</li>

                                            The variable annuity plan includes varieties in the annuity payments between one payout and the following. This variety is in significant part connected to the market execution of the speculations made by the benefits store or annuity plan that the individual has put resources into.</li>

                                        <p>Endowment plans are traditional long- term, regular savings plans with a fixed term. They are an ideal choice for customers who want to avoid risk. At the end of the term you receive the sum assured plus accrued /guaranteed bonuses that have been declared over the years, as a lump sum. In case of unfortunate death the sum assured with or without bonus as per the policy condition is paid to the nominee.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Death as well as Survival benefits</strong> In case of demise of the insured, the beneficiary/nominee of the policy gets the sum assured along with bonuses. Also, the insured is allowed to get the sum assured if he/she outlives the policy.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Higher returns:</strong> An endowment policy is helpful in building a corpus for future and providing financial protection to your family. The payout for survival benefit and death benefit of an endowment plan is higher than that of a pure LIFE INSURANCE POLICY i.e. Term Plans.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Premium payment frequency:</strong>  The policyholder can make payment of the premium based on the policy chosen by him/her. Payment can be done on monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, and on yearly basis.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Tax Benefits:</strong>  The policyholder is entitled to get tax exemption on both premium payments, maturity and final payouts under the Section 80C and Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Low Risk:</strong>  Traditional Endowment policies are considered safer as compared to the other investment option such as the Mutual Fund or the ULIPâ€™s because the amount here is not directly invested in equity funds or the stock market</li>

                                            <li><strong>Unit Linked Endowment Plan:</strong> Under Unit Linked policies, the insurance premiums are bifurcated into multiple units held under a specific investment fund which can be chosen by the policyholders.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Full /With Profit Endowment</strong> Under this plan, the basic amount i.e. sum assured will be provided to the policy holder. This amount is guaranteed right from the start of the policy. However, the final payout provided is comparatively higher depending on the bonuses announced from time to time by the company. The bonuses once declared form a part of the policy are paid out in the event of death of the policyholder or maturity of the policy.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Low-Cost Endowment</strong>
