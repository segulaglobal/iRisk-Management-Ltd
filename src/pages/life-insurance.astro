                    <p class="mb-8 leading-loose">A life insurance policy is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder that offers financial coverage under which in the unfortunate event of the insured person's demise during the term of life insurance plans the insurance company guarantees to pay a certain amount to the nominated beneficiary. In exchange, the policyholder agrees to pay a predefined amount of money as premium either on a regular basis or as a single premium. Buying Life Insurance has many advantages including its usage as a loan collateral, smooth continuity of business and also tax benefits.</p>

                                        <p>The purest and most basic form of Life Insurance is called Term Insurance Plan. Term Plans help you safeguard your family from financial worries that arise due to unfortunate circumstances. Term plans are pure risk cover plans with or without maturity benefits. These pure risk plans cover your life at a nominal cost for a specific period or term.
                                        <br><br>
                                        They are all the more important if you are the chief wage earner in your family. No matter how much you have saved or invested over the years, sudden eventualities, such as death or critical illness, always tend to affect your family financially apart from the huge emotional loss. Term plans also let you avail of the benefit to cover your outstanding debts like mortgage, home loan, etc. In case something happens to you, the financial burden is borne by the insurance company and not your loved ones</p>

                                            <ul class="list-disc leading-loose ml-12">
                                                <li><strong>Claim Settlement Ratio</strong> 
                                                <br>
                                                The insurerâ€™s claim settlement ratio provides a clear picture of the insurance provider to the prospect policy buyers. The ratio of claim settlement is released by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) India every year. A claim settlement ratio that is consistently good indicates that the insurance provider has been quick and robust in its claim settlement process
                                            </li>
                                                <li><strong>Solvency Ratio</strong> 
                                                    <br>
                                                    The solvency ratio is something that tells whether the insurance provider chosen will be capable financially for settling the claims if the requirement arises. As per IRDA, every life insurance provider should maintain a solvency ratio of 1.5 at least.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Enhanced Cover</strong> 
                                                    <br>
                                                    Some insurance companies offer the option of enhanced cover in the term insurance policy. In this option, the policyholders can enhance the coverage of the policy under particular circumstances or critical situations.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Riders</strong> 
                                                    <br>
                                                    While purchasing a term plan, it is important to check the rider benefits offered by the insurance company such as terminal illness, critical illness etc. An insurance rider is extra to the essential plan that offers advantages far beyond the subject of the policy in case of any eventuality</li>
                                                <li><strong>Premium</strong> 
                                                    <br>
                                                    The premium rate of a term insurance plan plays a vital role while purchasing the plan. Hence it is important to compare term insurance policies online and choose the term plan which offers higher coverage at an affordable premium rate. Additionally, choose a company that provides discounted premiums to non-smokers</li>

                                        <p class="mb-8">If your bike meets with an accident, you can simply claim insurance against the repair expenses without bearing the load on your own pocket.</p>

                                        <p class="blue-text font-medium">Third Party Liability</p>
                                        <p>In case of an accident, the insurance policy will provide cover to reimburse damages to the third partyâ€™s vehicle or property. Additionally, medical expenses incurred for treatment or hospitalisation expenses are also taken care of.</p>

                                        <p class="blue-tex">Safety Against Natural Disasters</p>
                                        <p class="mb-8">If your bike is damaged due to flood, fire or earthquake, your comprehensive bike insurance policy will cover for the damages.</p>

                                        <p class="blue-text font-medium">Cover Against Theft and Vandalism</p>
                                        <p class="mb-8">Comprehensive bike insurance provides you cover against theft and vandalism. You can get your hard-earned money back if your car gets stolen.</p>

                                        <p class="blue-text font-medium">No Claim Bonus</p>
                                        <p>In case no loss arises, you get rewarded a No Claim Bonus (NCB) for not filing any bike insurance claim that year. This makes your insurance renewal premium cheaper.</p>
