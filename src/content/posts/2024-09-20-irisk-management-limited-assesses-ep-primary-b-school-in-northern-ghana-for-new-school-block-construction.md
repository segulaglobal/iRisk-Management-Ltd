In an inspiring move aimed at improving education infrastructure in the northern region of Ghana, Irisk Management Limited, a leading insurance brokerage firm, recently conducted a comprehensive assessment of **EP Primary B School**. The evaluation is part of the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts, focused on constructing new school blocks to provide a conducive learning environment for children.

EP Primary B School, located in a rural area, currently faces the challenge of operating under inadequate infrastructure, often forcing students to attend classes under trees. This not only exposes the children to harsh weather conditions but also negatively impacts their ability to learn and thrive.

During the assessment, the headmaster of EP Primary B School, Mr. Saddick, expressed his gratitude to Irisk Management Limited. He emphasized the significance of this initiative in eliminating the challenges of teaching under trees and creating a better educational environment for the children. **He stated:** 

> We are deeply appreciative of Irisk Management Limited for this thoughtful initiative. The construction of new school blocks will not only enhance the education of these young minds but will also instill hope in the community. I encourage more corporate entities to follow this exemplary path and invest in the future of our children.

This endeavor by Irisk Management Limited demonstrates a commitment to community development beyond the core services of insurance brokerage. The company recognizes that education is a crucial tool in breaking the cycle of poverty and creating long-term impact.

As the project moves forward, the community is hopeful that the new school blocks will serve as a stepping stone toward a brighter future for the children of EP Primary B School, paving the way for other schools in the region to benefit from similar CSR initiatives by corporations across Ghana.

Irisk Management Limited’s actions are a powerful reminder that businesses can contribute positively to society, driving meaningful change that goes beyond profits and growth.
