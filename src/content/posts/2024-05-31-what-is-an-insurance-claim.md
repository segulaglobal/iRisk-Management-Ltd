An insurance claim is a formal request made by an insured or policyholder to an insurance company for compensation for a loss covered under an insurance policy. The purpose of filing an insurance claim is to seek indemnification, which means being put back into the same financial position the insured was in before the loss occurred.

**Insurance details:** Note insurance information and inspect the roadworthiness of the other vehicle(s) involved. Take photos of the scene.

**Police:** Contact the police to properly document the incident and pursue any guilty parties.

**Insurance claim:** Notify your insurance broker or representative to file a claim. This will notify the insurer of a loss as soon as it occurs, note that prompt reporting of the loss is crucial for the preservation of evidence that may be critical in determining if a claim is valid.

**Estimates:** Obtain repair estimates from authorized sources, as well as any hospitalization costs, and present them to the insurer for further investigation on claim settlement.

**Claim form:** Carefully describe the incident as it happened on the claim form. Be truthful to facilitate the insurer's investigation (this speeds claims processing).

*When the investigation is complete and you have submitted all documentation, the insurer will issue a discharge voucher (DV) so you can commence repairs.*

**Payment:** Discharge voucher would have to be signed and returned to the insurer in other for payment to be done. Upon the receipt of the signed Discharge voucher, the insurer shall pay the claimant within five(5) working days.

Irrespective of the type of motor insurance policy, all the processes leading to the payment of claims shall not exceed four(4) weeks from the date when all the documents have been submitted.
