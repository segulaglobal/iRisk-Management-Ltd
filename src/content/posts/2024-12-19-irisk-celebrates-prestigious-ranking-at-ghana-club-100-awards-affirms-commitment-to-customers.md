At the grand Ghana Club 100 Awards ceremony held on October 25, 2024 at the La Palm Royal Hotel, iRisk was celebrated as one of Ghana’s top-performing companies, securing an impressive 45th place overall and being ranked as the 3rd best insurance brand in the country.

The Ghana Club 100, organised annually by the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC), is one of Ghana’s most prestigious corporate awards, recognising companies that have achieved outstanding performance across various sectors and made significant contributions to the nation’s economic development.

The 2024 Ghana Club 100 Awards, themed “Accelerating Economic Growth: Amplifying Ghana’s Global Market Footprint through AFCFTA,” celebrated companies in diverse sectors, from ICT to finance, showcasing their achievements and positive impact.

The selection criteria for this esteemed ranking were rigorous, with companies assessed on size, growth, profitability, and impact, including contributions to employment, taxation, and community development. Independent auditing firm KPMG oversaw the evaluation process, ensuring transparency and adherence to international standards.

Founded to provide robust insurance brokerage and risk management services, iRisk has grown into a recognisable brand within Ghana’s insurance sector, known for its customer-centric solutions, innovative products, and commitment to responsible practices.

The iRisk brand also set up a reinsurance brokerage firm which places risks globally and especially in the EMEA region. iRisk has over the years played a pivotal role in raising industry standards and promoting accessible, inclusive insurance solutions that address the needs of both individuals and businesses.

iRisk’s focus on sustainable growth and community impact has established it as a trusted name in Ghana’s financial services landscape, supporting clients across a range of sectors and contributing to economic stability.

Reflecting on iRisk’s achievement, Managing Director, Sheila Wristberg expressed gratitude for the recognition and affirmed the company’s dedication to its clients and stakeholders.

“Being ranked 45th in the Ghana Club 100 and 3rd among insurance brands is a significant milestone for us. This honor reflects the hard work and commitment of our entire team and the loyalty of our clients,” she said.

“We are inspired by this achievement and promise to continue elevating our service standards, ensuring that our clients receive not only the best in insurance and risk management but also a partner they can rely on for sustainable and responsible solutions.”

With this recognition, iRisk is poised to continue its mission of expanding insurance accessibility and supporting Ghana’s broader economic goals through inclusive, impactful services.
