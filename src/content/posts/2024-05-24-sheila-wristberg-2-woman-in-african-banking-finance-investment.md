We are excited to announce a momentous achievement for our very own Sheila Wristberg, CEO of iRisk Management Limited. Sheila has been recognized as the #2 Woman to Watch in Banking, Finance & Investment in Africa by Angaza awards, and we couldn't be prouder of her outstanding accomplishment.

Sheila's journey with iRisk began in 2017 when she joined as an executive director, quickly rising to the position of managing director in 2018. Under her visionary leadership, iRisk has undergone a remarkable transformation, evolving from a startup into a reputable insurance brand in Ghana.

One of Sheila's remarkable achievements is leading iRisk's exponential revenue growth by an astonishing 1,000 percent. Her strategic acumen and innovative approach have propelled the company to become one of the leading insurance brokerage firms in Ghana, despite its relatively recent establishment.

Beyond financial success, Sheila has demonstrated a commitment to inclusive insurance and sustainable practices. She has spearheaded initiatives to develop innovative insurance products tailored to meet the diverse needs of Ghana's population, including market stall insurance policies for women micro traders and bespoke group life insurance policies for motorcycle clubs.

Furthermore, Sheila's dedication to sustainable insurance practices is evident in iRisk's signing of the Nairobi Declaration on Sustainable Insurance, making the firm the first insurance brokerage and the third company in Ghana's insurance industry to do so.

Sheila's impact extends beyond iRisk Management Limited. She serves as the Vice-Treasurer of the Insurance Brokers Association of Ghana (IBAG) and represents IBAG on various committees focused on sustainable economic development and inclusive insurance planning.

In recognition of her exceptional leadership and transformative impact on the financial services sector, we celebrate Sheila Wristberg's well-deserved recognition as the #2 Woman to Watch in Banking, Finance & Investment in Africa. Her trailblazing spirit and dedication to excellence continue to inspire us all as we work towards shaping the future of the insurance industry in Ghana and beyond. Congratulations, Sheila!
